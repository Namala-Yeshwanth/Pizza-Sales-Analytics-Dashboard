# 🍕 Pizza Sales Analytics Dashboard


## Overview
This project is a complete analysis of a pizza store’s sales data using SQL and dashboarding. The goal was to understand how the business is performing, what customers are buying, and when most orders happen.
Instead of just pulling numbers, I tried to look at this like a real business problem:
“If I were running this pizza store, what should I know to grow revenue and improve operations?”

## 📊 What this project covers
I worked with a real-world style dataset of pizza orders and analyzed:
- Total revenue and total orders
- How many pizzas are sold per order
- Which pizza categories and sizes make the most money
- Which days and hours are the busiest
- Best-selling and worst-selling pizzas
All of this was calculated using SQL and then visualized in a dashboard.

### 🧰 Tools Used
- SQL – for all calculations and analysis
- Excel – for raw data storage
- PowerPoint / Dashboard tool – for building the final dashboard

### 📁 Dataset
- The dataset contains details such as:
- Order ID
- Date and time
- Pizza name, category and size
- Quantity
- Price

### 🧮 SQL Analysis
All KPIs and trends were calculated using SQL, including:
- Total Revenue
- Average Order Value
- Total Orders
- Total Pizzas Sold
- Daily and Hourly order trends
- Sales by category and size
- Top 5 and Bottom 5 pizzas

### 📈 Dashboard
- The dashboard shows everything in one place:
- KPIs at the top
- Daily and hourly trends
- Category and size breakdown
- Best and worst selling pizzas

### 🔍 Key Insights
Some interesting things this analysis revealed:
- Orders are highest on weekends, especially Friday and Saturday evenings
- Most orders come in between 12–1 PM and after 5 PM
- Classic category pizzas generate the highest sales
- Large size pizzas bring in the most revenue
- A few pizzas contribute heavily to sales, while some barely sell

#### This kind of information is exactly what a business would use for:
- Menu planning
- Inventory control
- Promotions
- Staffing decisions
